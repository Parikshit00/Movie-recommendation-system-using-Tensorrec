# What is TensorRec?
TensorRec is a Python recommendation system that allows you to quickly develop recommendation algorithms and customize them using TensorFlow.

TensorRec lets you to customize your recommendation system's representation/embedding functions and loss functions while TensorRec handles the data manipulation, scoring, and ranking to generate recommendations.

A TensorRec system consumes three pieces of data: `user_features`, `item_features`, and `interactions`. It uses this data to learn to make and rank recommendations.

##Dataset
For this recommender system, I have used the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
